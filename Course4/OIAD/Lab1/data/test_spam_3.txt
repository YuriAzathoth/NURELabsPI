On Wednesday nights we open the doors to a world of guilty pleasures by
inviting you to scoff on a tasty slab of musical fromage. Disco Dave
brings the cheese each and every week as we take a trip back through the
decades that time and taste forgot, paying tribute to those sing-along
retro classics we all know and secretly love.

Look out for big giveaways, fancy dress themes and special guests
throughout the year at Pop!, the ultimate student spectacular!

Season Passes include Circling & Event tickets for every POP! in that
term, saving Â£8 compared to buying individual tickets.
