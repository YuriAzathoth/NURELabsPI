Types of starships

You can find a few different types of starships - each one of them
serves a different purpose. The ships are divided into classes - from C
to S - this gives you an overall score for a particular machine. The
four main types of starships are:

Fighter - these ships are for space combat. They are fast and easy to
handle. You can install upgrades that will make them even faster and
more maneuverable.

Shuttle - ships for beginners with good combat capabilities and large
items capacity.

Hauler - a perfect ship for those who plan on trading. Can transport a
lot of items - thanks to that you can move your goods between systems
with ease.

Explorer - these ships can be equipped with a hyperdrive which means
that they are perfect for those who want to explore red, green and blue
systems.

How to buy a new starship?

To buy a starship you have to fly to a station or a trading post. Once
you get there, you have to approach a vehicle that you want to buy, and
speak with its owner. You can use the option to examine a starship (it
moves you to a special screen).

Here, you can examine its class and role. You can buy a ship immediately
or you can exchange it for one of your ships to get a discount.
How to sell a starship?

You can't sell starships. You can only exchange them to get a discount
when you are buying a new machine.

Exotic S class starships

During your journeys you can come across Exotic class starships. These
vehicles cost about 15 million units. They are available in trading
posts or space stations, just like other types of starships. However,
they are rare which means that you will have to wait for them to arrive.
