Thanks to our automated warehouse, we are able to prepare orders for
shipping until late into the night. We are proud to offer fast and
professional delivery services with all major payment methods available
through our online shop. Additionally, if you require some flexibility
regarding payment, we provide finance options so you can pay in
instalments (for UK and Germany only).

Package Discounts

The new shop also features a package discount system, which offers an
increasing discount with every additional item purchased. This is
essentially a digital, automated version of a salesperson giving a
customer a discount for large purchases.

original packaging. It is extremely rare that you will receive an
instrument that has been on display in our shop. Exceptions are
exclusive Custom Shop instruments.
