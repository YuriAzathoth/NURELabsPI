It's not just rockets, satellites, and billionaires that are flying to
space - advertising is too.

We provide technology services, exclusively told Insider that it's
making space advertising possible with the help of SpaceX.

The company is in the process of building a satellite, called a CubeSat.
One side of the satellite will have a pixelated display screen where the
advertisements, logos, and art will appear.

Once in orbit, a selfie-stick attached to the side of the CubeSat will
film the display screen. This footage will be livestreamed on YouTube or
Twitch so anyone can tune in to watch the satellite's screen. The
CubeSat will be released in early 2021. You can buy tokens for the
pixels in crypto

To advertise on the CubeSat, you have to buy tokens to claim, locate,
and design a pixel on the display screen. You can buy the tokens with
cryptocurrencies such as ethereum.

There are five tokens to choose from - Beta for the X coordinate, Rhoe
for the Y coordinate, Gamma for the brightness, Kappa for the colour,
and XI for time. With the Beta and Rhoe tokens, people can decide where
to place their pixel. The Gamma and Kappa tokens allow people to control
what their pixel will look like, while the XI token determines how long
it will last for.

Reid couldn't reveal how much each token or CubeSat would cost. SpaceX
didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Anyone can advertise on a CubeSat
