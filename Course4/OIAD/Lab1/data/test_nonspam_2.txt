History of the automobile

Development of the automobile started in 1672 with the invention of the
first steam-powered vehicle, which led to the creation of the first
steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation, built by
Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769. Inventors began to branch out at the
start of the 19th century, creating the de Rivas engine, one of the
first internal combustion engines, and an early electric motor. Samuel
Brown later tested the first industrially applied internal combustion
engine in 1826.

The Ford Model T (foreground) and Volkswagen Beetle (background) are
among the most mass-produced car models in history.

Development was hindered in the mid-19th century by a backlash against
large vehicles, yet progress continued on some internal combustion
engines. The engine evolved as engineers created two- and four-cycle
combustion engines and began using gasoline as fuel. Production vehicles
began appearing in 1887, when Carl Benz developed a gasoline-powered
automobile and made several identical copies. Recent automobile
production is marked by the Ford Model T, created by the Ford Motor
Company in 1908, which became the first automobile to be mass-produced
on a moving assembly line.
