Transport (in British English), or transportation (in American English),
is the movement of humans, animals, and goods from one location to
another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as a
particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in
space) to a point B.

Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable,
pipeline, and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure,
vehicles, and operations. Transport enables trade between people, which
is essential for the development of civilizations.

Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including
roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals, and pipelines and terminals
such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking
terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations),
and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers
and cargo and for maintenance.

Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport
facilities used to carry people or cargo. They may include vehicles,
riding animals, and pack animals. Vehicles may include wagons,
automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft,
spacecraft, and aircraft.
